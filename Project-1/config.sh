# Symbolic Link Script
# ---------------------
# This script automates the setup of symbolic links for configuration and executable files from a Git repository
# to specific directories on the user's system
# The script allows the user to:
#   - Specify a custom location to clone the repository.
#   - Organize cloned files into the ~/bin and ~/.config directories

# GitHub repository URL to clone
repo_to_clone="https://gitlab.com/cit2420/2420-as2-starting-files"

# Default directory to clone the repository; falls back to "$HOME/config_files" if no location is specified.
def_repo_loc="$HOME/config_files"

# Define an error handler function, `error_exit`, to handle error messages consistently throughout the script.
# If an error occurs, this function displays an error message and exits with a non-zero status code.
# Using functions for handling errors is a best practice in Bash scripting for reusability and readability.

# Check if Git is installed by verifying if the `git` command is available.
# Using `command -v` with `&>/dev/null` suppresses command output, checking if Git exists.
# If Git is not installed, the script calls `error_exit` to display an error and terminate.
