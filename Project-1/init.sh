# Init script
# --------------
# This script manages system setup tasks by running installation and configuration scripts as specified by user options.
# It checks if the user is running the script as root, provides a menu for available options, and uses `getopts` to parse options.

# Checking if the script is run with root privileges by evaluating $EUID (Effective User ID).
# $EUID will be 0 for the root user. If not, the script will display an error and exit.
# This is important because creating users and modifying system files requires root access.

# `dirname` extracts the directory path from a full path.
