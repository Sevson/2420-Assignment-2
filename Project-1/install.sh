# install Script
# ---------------------------
# This script automates the installation of packages listed in a specified file (by default, "packages").
# It reads through each line in the file, ignores blank and commented lines, checks if each package is already installed,
# and installs any missing packages.

# Define the file containing the list of packages to install.
# This file should contain package names, one per line.
file="packages"

# Loop through each line in the specified package file.
# loop structure - reads each line from the input file and assigns it to the variable `package`.
# Reference for while loop and read file: https://www.javatpoint.com/bash-while-loop + https://www.javatpoint.com/bash-read-file
while read package; do

    # Skip empty lines or lines starting with `#`, which are comments.
    # `-z "$package"` checks if the line is empty (returns true for an empty string).
    # `"$package" == \#*` checks if the line starts with `#`, marking it as a comment.
    # If either condition is met, `continue` skips to the next line.
